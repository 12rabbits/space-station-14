|| RP INFO ||  
This is classified as a Medium RP server. What that basically means is that unlike Heavy RP sillyness is allowed and
actively encouraged. But it must be within the confines of a character who has an in-character reason for being silly.
Basically, have an in-character reason for doing things and such. Be creative!
