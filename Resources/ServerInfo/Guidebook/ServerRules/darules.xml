|| RP INFO ||  

This is classified as a Medium RP server. What that basically means is that ,unlike Heavy RP, sillyness is allowed and
actively encouraged. But it must be within the confines of a character who has an in-character reason for being silly.
Basically, have a reason for what you're doing. Be creative!
