  The Server rules are intended to be guidelines and references for good behavior and not ironclad, immovable laws. If YOU believe you have a funny concept going into a round and it toes the line of a server rule, you can try the bit out, but be aware that admins CAN and WILL smite you if it isn't actually funny. Be careful!
